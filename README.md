# Project Plan and Architecture

## Planned Architecture
At the start of the project, I made a class diagram to show how the different parts of the game would work together. I used a tool like Draw.io to create it. This diagram helped me stay organized and clear about the structure of the project.

## What We Did and When

1. **Week 1: Starting the Project**
   - Set up the project and tools needed for development.
   - Wrote a simple `README.md` file to explain the project.
   - Created a class diagram to plan how the main parts (like `Player`, `GameScreen`, and `MainScreen`) would connect.

2. **Week 2: Building the Game**
   - Built the main features of the game, like the `Player` and `GameScreen`.
   - Added other parts, like `NPC`,  `Logger`, to make the game work.
   - Tested the connections between the classes to make sure everything worked as planned.

3. **Week 3: Finishing Up**
   - Tested everything to make sure the game worked well.
   - Fixed and improved the code based on testing.
   - Updated the class diagram and the `README.md` file to match the final version of the project.

This plan helped me stay focused and finish the project on time.
